**The Project:** For our Module 4 project we were given the freedom to choose our own dataset. For that dataset we would then create a model that will solve a problem we have assigned as our focus.

**The Goal:** the goal of this project is to show my knowledge of the data science process.

**The Problem:** The company TalkingData has reached out to us for help! The ads for  mobile apps are getting clicks and downloads at an alarming rates, something just isn't addding up. So they have hired us to determine if the downloads are fraudelent or not. It's binary classification problem!


**The Data:** Two years ago the TalkingData AdTracking Fraud Detection Challenge was brought to Kaggle, along with provided data of "200 million clicks over 4 days". See repository to be guided to the data as well as the competition.
